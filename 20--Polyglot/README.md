# Getting Started

In order to run the file run $ pip install -r requirements.txt in your virtual environment.  

You will also need to download the files below and unzip them into a directory titled data in the same folder with the ipython notebook. https://alioth.debian.org/snapshots.php?group_id=100815

Once you've done that run $ ipython notebook to open the notebook and select programming-language-classifier.ipynb.

Make sure to run the cells in order from top to bottom or the code might break.

## Description

I created a classifier that can take snippets of code and guesses the programming language of the code.

It's more accurate with longer snips of code and has issues with some languages.
